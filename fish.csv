Once illuminated, it looks like a firework frozen in time, its very poisonous and thin tendrils glowing brilliantly away from its body. Sightings of this jellyfish are very rare for one big reason: when it feels threatened, it releases a charge that can break the sound barrier, and sends out a concussive wave that can be felt even on the surface. Caution is highly suggested if more than one is encountered.",Niki (@_Ssunburst__),Brainy (@pinstripedoc),"A Halitrephes also known as a Firework Jellyfish.

Researchers do not have much information about them, but they possess a unique, glow-in-the-dark pattern similar to that of a certain guild leader. They can turn this pattern off to hide themselves from predators and ambush other species as a pack. The Eelpout have also been observed to lay eggs and protect their offspring. Despite their name and appearance, they are NOT related to eels at all.",CTS,Lambdadelta (@ulambdadelta),"A brightly coloured Eelspout.
